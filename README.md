# Coursera - Algorithms: Robert Sedgewick & Kevin Wayne

## Description
> This is a repository of my solutions to the Algorithms project assignments. 
If you're taking this class, do yourself a favor and complete the projects yourself. 
If your stuck completing a project, post your issues on the class forum. 

All of the source code for this class is generally quickly hacked together to satisfy only
the assignment requirements. Furthermore, many of the project restrictions prevent the use
of common software engineering techniques, that would improve coupling, and testability, 
such as, inheritance, dependency injection, etc. So, be warned.
